# Data-Wrangling---WeRateDogs-
Investigate tweets about top rated dogs

## Introduction
WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a rating more than 10/10. Another data source is image prediction also there is another source about favorite count and retweet. But there is important question that needs good analysis to answer "Which is the favorite type?"

Is it the most frequent type?

Is it the type with highest average rating?

Is it the type that has highest retweets and favorite counts?

Can we depend on the first image only to determine the dog type?
